For example, calling wordlclim(1:19) will download and extract everything, and future calls will be much faster.\n\nVariable Description\n1 Annual Mean Temperature\n2 Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp - min temp))\n3 Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (* 100)\n4 Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100)\n5 Max Temperature of Warmest Month\n6 Min Temperature of Coldest Month\n7 Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6)\n8 Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter\n9 Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter\n10 Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter\n11 Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter\n12 Annual Precipitation\n13 Precipitation of Wettest Month\n14 Precipitation of Driest Month\n15 Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation)\n16 Precipitation of Wettest Quarter\n17 Precipitation of Driest Quarter\n18 Precipitation of Warmest Quarter\n19 Precipitation of Coldest Quarter\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn a single layer from WorldClim 2.0.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn a range of layers from WorldClim 2.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#","page":"Simple SDM Layers","title":"Simple SDM Layers","text":"latitudes\nlongitudes","category":"page"},{"location":"#SimpleSDMLayers.latitudes","page":"Simple SDM Layers","title":"SimpleSDMLayers.latitudes","text":"latitudes(p::T) where {T <: SimpleSDMLayer}\n\nReturns an iterator with the latitudes of the SDM layer passed as its argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#SimpleSDMLayers.longitudes","page":"Simple SDM Layers","title":"SimpleSDMLayers.longitudes","text":"longitudes(p::T) where {T <: SimpleSDMLayer}\n\nReturns an iterator with the longitudes of the SDM layer passed as its argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"man/types/#Types-1","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"man/types/#","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"SimpleSDMLayer\nSimpleSDMResponse\nSimpleSDMPredictor","category":"page"},{"location":"man/types/#SimpleSDMLayers.SimpleSDMLayer","page":"Types","title":"SimpleSDMLayers.SimpleSDMLayer","text":"All types in the package are part of the abstract type SimpleSDMLayer.
